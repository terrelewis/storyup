# storyup
A social app wherein a group of friends collaborate to create a story in a limited timeframe.
The primary idea of the app revolves around being able to easily collaborate with your friends 
(via integration to social networking sites) to create a story that everyone would want to read. 
There are three main components to this app:
•	Grouping of users: This phase aims at grouping random users who are logged into the app and are looking to play. 
The grouping can be done randomly or by sending explicitly sending invites to friends in the social circle.
•	Playing the game: Once the users are grouped, they can start playing the games in a turn based manner wherein 
each user will have to add a line in a limited timeframe thereby creating a story eventually

P.S: This app is still under development and it is not bug free
